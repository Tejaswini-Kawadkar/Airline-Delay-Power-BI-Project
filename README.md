# Airline-Delay-Power-BI-Project

### Problem Statement:
According to air travel consumer reports, a large proportion of consumer complaints are
about frequent flight delays.
Out of all the complaints received from consumers about airline services, 32% were
related to cancellations, delays, or other deviations from the airlinesâ€™ schedules.
There are unavoidable delays that can be caused by air traffic, no passengers at the
airport, weather conditions, mechanical issues, passengers coming from delayed
connecting flights, security clearance, and aircraft preparation.

### Objective:
The objective of this project is to identify the factors that contribute to avoidable flight delays.

### Overview:
#### Dashboard 1:
1. Dashboard 1 shows total flights which are 539K out of which 240K flights were delayed & 299K flights were on time. 
2. There were a total of 18 airlines and the delay index was 0.45.
3. The first chart on our dashboard is the area chart for number of delayed flights and number of on time flights according to the airline which will help to determine which airline has the highest and lowest number of flight delays. We plotted airlines on the x-axis and the measures for number of delays and on time departures on the y-axis.
4. The next chart shows the total flights by weekdays. Airline WN had the highest number of flights. HA had the least.

1. The delay index is a metric used to quantify the overall level of delays experienced by flights at an airport, airline, or in a specific region. The delay index takes into account the frequency, duration, and magnitude of delays to give a comprehensive assessment of the delay situation.
<br>2. The highest was 0.70 of WN Airline.

### Dashboard 2:
1. The first chart on our dashboard is the sum of delays of flights by the airlines.
2. The pie chart shows the percentage of flights on time and delayed flights. By calculating the percentages of on-time and delayed flights, airlines and airports can assess their performance in meeting schedule commitments and identify areas for improvement to reduce delays and
improve overall customer satisfaction.
3. Wednesday had more flights than any other day of the week, Friday had the least.
4. More flights were taken from Los Angeles Airport to San Francisco Airport than any other airport.
5. WN-28 flight had the highest number of flight.
